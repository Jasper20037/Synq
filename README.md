# Noise Cancellation Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Noise Cancellation Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and controlling noise levels in gym halls. The system includes a user-friendly dashboard that allows users to view overall data for all gym halls, analyze historical trends, and access valuable information related to noise control.

## How It Works

### Dashboard

- **Overall Data:** The dashboard provides an overview of data for all gym halls and all time. Users can access general information by clicking on the information icon, gaining insights into measured data.

- **Summary Page (Login Required):** Users can log in to access the summary page, which displays a clear overview of general data for the past 12 days. This includes the percentage increase in decibels since the last 12-day measurement and the general decibel levels over the past weekdays.

- **Analytics Page (Login Required):** The analytics page allows users to view graphical representations of noise levels in gym halls over user-selected durations. Options include the past year, the past month, the past 2 weeks, and the past 7 days.

- **Information Page:** Access the latest developments in noise cancellation for gym halls. This page features news articles, blogs, and other resources that provide insights into new developments in noise cancelation.

- **Contact Page:** Users can reach out to Synq (us) for more information or request insights into specific noise data. The contact page serves as a communication hub for any inquiries related to the project.
